    you explain how to use the spanning marks in Arabic
    script?</em></h4>
    <p>Some characters in Arabic script are signs that span (or enclose)
    numbers, such as U+06DD End of Ayah and U+0605 Number Mark Above.
    See <a href="spanning.html">Signs Spanning Numbers</a> for an
    extensive explanation.</p>

    design of NOON GHUNNA and some of the other characters do not follow
    my expected dot pattern. Can you please fix the design?</em></h4>
    <p>SIL fonts have implemented the behavior for NOON GHUNNA and other
    characters as defined and documented by Unicode. See <a
    href="differentpattern.html">Characters which follow a different dot
    pattern</a> for a list of characters which may follow and different
    pattern than expected.</p>

    do I get correct display for "Chapter:Verse" references using a
    regular "Roman" colon?</em></h4>
    <p>In RTL texts a “chapter:verse” reference is often written as
    "verse:chapter" or "endverse-startverse:chapter". For example:</p>
    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Chapter</th>
    <th>Verse</th>
    <th>LTR rendering:</th>
    <th>Desired RTL rendering:</th>

    <td>12:34-56</td>
    <td>56-34:12</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Digits can display in different orders, depending on the
    punctuation around them.</p>

    <p>For option a, the RLM (U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK) is inserted
    before the colon and before the hyphen. For option b, the RLM is
    inserted before the colon and the LRM (U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK) is
    inserted before the hyphen. Option b is rather unusual, but it is
    used in some regions.</p>
    <p>This was tested in LibreOffice and NotePad. It is important to
    insert the marks in both positions in order to have consistent
    behavior across different applications. Unfortunately, Word has its
    own issues with how it handles this. The <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/arabicfonts/right-to-left-scripts-in-microsoft-office/">Right-to-left
    scripts in Microsoft Office</a> template will be useful to read and
    use for Word documents.</p>
    <h3 id="general-use-in-applications">General Use in
    Applications</h3>
    <h4
    id="how-do-i-use-arabic-script-in-microsoft-office"><a name="msoffice"></a><em>How
    do I use Arabic script in Microsoft Office?</em></h4>
    <p>The ability to display right-to-left (RTL) and other complex
    scripts is built into the standard editions of Microsoft Office
    since Office 2000.</p>
    <p>These instructions are written for Office 2016 on Windows 10.
    However, similar steps can be taken on older applications and
    versions of Windows. First, close any Office applications that are
    open. Next, you must enable an Arabic language in <strong>Microsoft
    Office 2016 Tools / Office 2016 Language Preferences</strong> (in
    the Start menu). Click on <strong>Add additional editing
    languages</strong> and choose one of the Arabic languages. Then
    click on "Add". The Keyboard Layout will say "Not enabled". If you
    think you'll need to type in Arabic, now would be a good time to
    double-click on that and select an Arabic keyboard.</p>
    <p>Now you can open Word. If you go to <strong>File / Options /
    Advanced</strong> you can select <strong>Cursor movement</strong>
    under <strong>Editing options</strong>. Under <strong>Show document
    content</strong> you can choose whether you want "Arabic" or "Hindi"
    numerals, choose to show <strong>Diacritics</strong> in another
    color if desired, and you can choose to set the <strong>Document
    view</strong> to Right-to-left. All of these choices affect your
    whole document. Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
    <p>Note for RTL books (e.g., Arabic books, etc.) in Microsoft Word,
    to get page headers to flow properly from right to left, you need to
    go to <strong>File / Options / Advanced / Show document content /
    Document view</strong> and set it to Right-to-left. This option is
    only available if you have a RTL language installed in Windows. This
    language can get added to all documents by using the "Microsoft
    Office Tools" program. Unfortunately, when you set the Right-to-left
    option in <strong>Options</strong>, this affects every document you
    open. This means that if you are switching between LTR and RTL
    books, you will need to change this setting each time you switch to
    a file with a different format.</p>
    <p>It's also possible to just set Paragraph direction for one or
    more paragraphs in your document. You should now have a
    Right-to-left and Left-to-right icon selection. To do that, choose
    the Paragraph marker with triangle pointing left for setting text to
    be Right-to-left. This should also automatically change the
    paragraph to "Align Right".</p>

    <p>This will get you a long way toward using Arabic script in
    Microsoft Office. There are sometimes other issues and if you run
    into problems, you will likely want to use the document template
    that we have created and linked to below.</p>
    <p>In the link below, a document template provides helpful hints on
    use of RTL scripts in Microsoft Word 2000 or later. Included are
    general instructions for getting such scripts to work correctly,
    known bugs and weaknesses, and various tips and tricks. There are
    also some macros that may be helpful when working with RTL
    scripts.</p>
    <p>The template is available here: <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/arabicfonts/right-to-left-scripts-in-microsoft-office/">Right-to-left
    scripts in Microsoft Office</a>.</p>
    <h4
    id="how-do-i-use-arabic-script-in-indesign"><a name="indd"></a><em>How
    do I use Arabic script in InDesign?</em></h4>
    <p>There are several settings you must check in order to have proper
    rendering in InDesign. First of all, in the Character widget, you
    should make sure your text is tagged with the
    <strong>Arabic</strong> language. The <strong>Opentype</strong>
    <strong>Contextual Alternates</strong> should be selected and
    <strong>Kerning</strong> should set to <strong>Metrics</strong> or
    "0". The default for <strong>Kerning</strong> seems to be
    <strong>Optical</strong>, but when that is set there might be tiny
    spaces between the characters which you do not want. Next, in the
    Paragraph widget, make sure your text is tagged with the
    <strong>Adobe World-Ready Paragraph Composer</strong> and possibly
    set your text to <strong>Align Right</strong>.</p>
    <p>You do not need Indesign ME or World Tools to get RTL working
    properly in Indesign. You can edit the Windows registry and change
    the Feature Set Locale from 100 to 103 to get most of what you need.
    First, please backup your registry in case you run into problems. <a
    href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/322756">Instructions
    for backing up your registry are available here</a>. Next, using
    regedit (type the Windows key, type in regedit and hit enter), go to
    the InDesign Feature Set Locale Setting.</p>
    <p>The RegEdit window will look something like this afterwards:</p>

    id="how-do-i-use-arabic-script-in-indesign-me"><a name="ME"></a><em>How
    do I use Arabic script in InDesign ME?</em></h4>
    <p>Some people have run into problems with the combining marks
    behaving improperly (farther away from the base character than the
    font design intended, or even above a character when it should be
    below). In that case, go to the Paragraph Stylesheet:</p>

    id="how-do-i-use-arabic-script-in-libreoffice"><a name="LO"></a><em>How
    do I use Arabic script in LibreOffice?</em></h4>
    <p>There are probably many levels to this question. We'll start by
    getting you set up properly in <a
    href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>. First of all
    you should enable Complex Text Layout (CTL) in LibreOffice. Do this
    by going to <strong>Tools &gt; Options &gt; Language Settings &gt;
    Languages</strong>. Then click on <strong>Show UI elements for
    Bi-Directional writing</strong>. Then go up to CTL and select an
    Arabic language such as <strong>Arabic (Saudi Arabia)</strong>.
    Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/LO_CTL.png" class="fullsize" alt="LO_CTL" />

    <figcaption>

    </figcaption>
    <p>Next, you should go to <strong>View &gt; Toolbars</strong> and
    make sure <strong>Formatting</strong> is selected. You should now
    see the Right-to-Left (RTL) button.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/LO_Formatting.jpeg" class="fullsize"

    <figcaption>
    Right-to-Left (RTL) button
    </figcaption>
    <p>You <em>may</em> need to restart LibreOffice before these buttons
    show up. Now, when you have Arabic script text you should make sure
    to select the text and click on the RTL button. This will ensure
    that all (or most) of your RTL directionality issues (such as
    punctuation and numbering) are resolved.</p>
    <p>If you wish to input Arabic script text you will also want a
    keyboard. You can either choose one of the operating system
    keyboards or if you have a <a href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman
    keyboard</a> you should associate it with an Arabic script language
    (such as <strong>Arabic (Saudi Arabia)</strong>). Associating your
    keyboard with <strong>Arabic (Saudi Arabia)</strong> <em>should</em>
    make LibreOffice switch to the <strong>Arabic (Saudi
    Arabia)</strong> language when you select your keyboard.</p>
    <h4
    id="i-am-experiencing-what-appears-to-be-corruption-of-my-data-in-libreoffice-when-i-use-one-of-your-fonts.-what-is-the-matter-and-how-do-i-fix-it"><a name="LOCorruption"></a><em>I
    am experiencing what appears to be corruption of my data in
    LibreOffice when I use one of your fonts. What is the matter and how
    do I fix it?</em></h4>
    <p>It is important that you have the latest version of <a
    href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> installed as
    that fixes some potential bugs.</p>
    <p>However, the problem is likely related to how Windows handles
    font installation. Some of our Scheherazade font testers have
    experienced this problem. It is likely caused because font testers
    were installing the font numerous times in testing. If you go to the
    Command Prompt and look in your <code>C:\Windows\Fonts</code>
    folder, you may discover that you have various versions of
    Scheherazade in that folder:</p>
    <pre><code>ScheherazadeNew-R.ttf
ScheherazadeNew-R*0.ttf
ScheherazadeNew-R*1.ttf</code></pre>
    <p>These various versions of the font will not show up if you just
    go to your font folder in Windows Explorer, they only show up if you
    go to the Command Prompt. It is important to get rid of all of
    these, reboot and then reinstall the latest version of the font.
    Hopefully that will resolve your problem.</p>
    <h4
    id="how-do-i-use-arabic-script-in-xetex-and-xelatex"><a name="xelatex"></a><em>How
    do I use Arabic script in XeTeX and XeLaTeX?</em></h4>
    <p>For an OpenType font in XeLaTex, the font declaration would
    be:</p>
    <pre><code>\newfontfamily\fontnast[Script=Arabic]{Jameel Noori Nastaleeq}</code></pre>
    <p>However, if it is a Graphite font, you need a different
    declaration:</p>
    <pre><code>\newfontfamily\urdufont[Renderer=Graphite]{Awami Nastaliq}</code></pre>
    <p>It would also be useful to add
    <code>\XeTeXinterwordspaceshaping=1</code> to your file. Thus, you
    might have:</p>
    <pre><code>\XeTeXinterwordspaceshaping=1
\newfontfamily\urdufont[Renderer=Graphite]{Awami Nastaliq}</code></pre>
    <h4
    id="some-of-the-characters-in-the-arabic-supplement-block-and-none-of-the-new-characters-in-the-arabic-extended-a-and-arabic-extended-b-blocks-are-rendering-correctly.-how-can-i-resolve-this-problem"><a name="render"></a><em>Some
    of the characters in the <strong>Arabic Supplement</strong> block
    and none of the new characters in the <strong>Arabic
    Extended-A</strong> and <strong>Arabic Extended-B</strong> blocks
    are rendering correctly. How can I resolve this problem?</em></h4>
    <p>Many of the characters in the <strong>Arabic Supplement</strong>
    block, and all of the characters in <strong>Arabic
    Extended-A</strong> and <strong>Arabic Extended-B</strong> were
    added to Unicode 5.1 or later. It has sometimes taken quite awhile
    for operating systems and/or applications to support these
    blocks.</p>
    <p>Additionally, support for our fonts may depend on which rendering
    system is used. Some of our fonts support <a
    href="https://graphite.sil.org/">Graphite</a> rendering only. Others
    may support only Opentype rendering and still others support both
    Graphite and Opentype.</p>
    <p>Most of our fonts also support the OpenType shaping features
    specified by <a
    href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/script-development/arabic">Microsoft</a>.
    The result is that the fonts work pretty well in Microsoft Office
    2010 (or later) as well as in most OpenType-based applications.
    Versions of Windows prior to Windows 8.1 do not include support for
    Unicode 6.1 and so do not support the Arabic Extended-A characters
    (U+08A0..U+08FF), nor a few new characters in the 06xx block.
    Windows 8.1 supports all Arabic script characters through Unicode
    6.1 (including the new <a
    href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U08A0.pdf">Arabic
    Extended-A</a> characters). Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and
    Mozilla's <a
    href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> and <a
    href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>
    <em>do</em> provide OpenType support for the new Arabic Extended-A
    characters.</p>
    <p>Please see our <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/arabicfonts/support/application-support">Application
    Support</a> page for a more complete listing of which applications
    support different levels of Arabic script.</p>

    Can you provide a TypeTuned WOFF font for me?</em></h4>
    <p>The great thing about web fonts is that you can use our standard
    normal fonts and let the CSS on your page handle the special
    alternate glyphs or behaviors that you are looking for. See <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/webfonts/">Using SIL Fonts on
    Web Pages (OpenType and Graphite feature support)</a> for
    instructions on using font features on web pages.</p>
    <h4
    id="how-do-i-use-a-language-feature"><a name="langfeat"></a><em>How
    do I use a language feature?</em></h4>
    <p>Many of our fonts support features for different languages. For
    example, <em>Scheherazade New</em> supports Urdu, Kurdish, Kyrgyz,
    Sindhi, Rohingya, and Wolof. If the application you are using
    supports the language, then you can select the text, select the
    appropriate font and then select the language. If you select
    "Sindhi" then the appropriate glyph variants for Sindhi should
    display.</p>

    <h4
    id="how-do-i-use-a-graphite-feature"><a name="gdlfeat"></a><em>How
    do I use a Graphite feature?</em></h4>
    <p>In a Graphite-enabled app where there is a proper UI: you can
    select the desired variant from the <strong>Format / Font /
    Feature</strong> menu (or however the interface is arranged).</p>
    <p>In LibreOffice the font features can be turned on by choosing the
    font (ie Scheherazade), followed by a colon, followed by the feature
    ID, and then followed by the feature setting. So, for example, if
    the “Meem: Sindhi-style” is desired, the font selection would be
    “Scheherazade:cv44=1” (see the features document for the specific
    font). If you wish to apply two (or more) features, you can separate
    them with an “&amp;”. Thus, “Scheherazade:cv44=1&amp;cv72=1” would
    apply “Meem: Sindhi-style” plus the “Dammatan:Six-nine” feature.</p>
    <h4
    id="how-do-i-use-a-feature-in-xetex"><a name="xetexfeat"></a><em>How
    do I use a feature in XeTeX?</em></h4>
    <p>The XeTeX typesetting system supports language features, OpenType
    Stylistic Sets and Character Variants as well as Graphite
    features.</p>
    <p>Include “feature=setting” pairs in the font specification within
    the source document or stylesheet; e.g.,
    <code>fontbodytext=""Scheherazade New/GR:Meem=Sindhi-style on baseline" at 12pt</code>
    (for Graphite), or
    <code>fontbodytext=""Scheherazade New:script=arab:+cv44=1 on baseline" at 12pt</code>
    (for OpenType). The syntax for this can be derived from the Font
    Features document for the specific font you are using.</p>
    <h4
    id="how-do-i-use-a-feature-in-xelatex"><a name="xelatexfeat"></a><em>How
    do I use a feature in XeLaTeX?</em></h4>
    <p>For XeLaTeX, the fontspec package must be used. The syntax might
    be something like:</p>
    <pre><code>\fontspec{Scheherazade New}[
Renderer=Graphite,
RawFeature={Dal=Alternate}</code></pre>

    The practical result of this means that you should expect to have
    different line lengths, paragraph length may be different, and line
    spacing may even be different. <em>You should not expect your
    document to have the same page layout as you do with the current
    font.</em></p>

    <p>Our focus for the Arabic script fonts is to provide excellent
    support for Arabic script. Adding complete Latin support for
    languages using both Arabic and Latin scripts would be too
    difficult. SIL does provide fonts that provide comprehensive Latin
    script support <a

    <p>Converting from Latin script (or any other script) to Arabic
    script is not usually a straightforward 1-1 conversion. However, it
    can be done. <a href="https://software.sil.org/teckit/">TECkit</a>,

    Converters</a>, and the following webpage will be helpful in the
