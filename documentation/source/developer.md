# About the fonts

SIL currently has six Arabic script fonts. These can be divided into three groups.

## Nastaliq. Graphite only

Covers only those characters that are used by languages using the Nastaliq script.

- Awami Nastaliq

## Naskh — Kano style. OpenType only

These fonts are in the Kano style of writing and cover only characters that are used by a subset of West African languages.
 
- Alkalami
- Ruwudu

## Naskh — traditional style. OpenType only

These traditional style fonts attempt to cover all the characters in the Arabic BMP blocks, excluding Presentations Forms.

- Scheherazade New - a widely used Naskh font.
- Lateef - developed for the Sindhi language and nearby languages. However, it is more widely used because it gives nice contrast for section headings and titles.
- Harmattan - for use in West Africa, although we have discovered it is more widely used because it is quite readable on mobile devices.

Note, however, that reh and waw kerning rules implemented in Harmattan are autogenerated by rendering text via Graphite rules that implement collision-avoidance-based kerning. Harmattan developers must, therefore, maintain both Graphite and OpenType font logic even though the released font contains only OpenType logic. For more information see Harmattan developer information.

# About OpenType FEA and FEAX source code

The OpenType "smarts" in most SIL fonts is authored in an extended version of [Adobe Feature File (FEA)](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko/blob/develop/docs/OpenTypeFeatureFileSpecification.md) syntax. To denote the use of these extensions, the file suffix `.feax` is used. Note that the extensions are mearly syntatic sugar in that they cannot do anything more than Adobe FEA files can do, but some complex and tedious code can be expressed more simply in FEAX than in FEA. For more information about FEAX, see [FEA Extensions](https://github.com/silnrsi/pysilfont/blob/master/docs/feaextensions.md).

# font-arab-tools

## absGlyphList/

This spreadsheet, maintained using Microsoft Excel and saved in both `.xslx` binary and `.csv` text formats, is used to manage the glyphs for all Naskh fonts. 
Changes are made first to the `.xlsx` file, from which the `.csv` file is generated. 
See specific instructions in the text box at the top of `absGlyphList.xlsx`.
Always commit matching `.xlsx` and `.csv` files, using the git diff of the `csv` files to check that all modifiations are as intended.

Project-specific `glyph_data.csv` files can be extracted from `absGlyphList.csv` using `tools/bin/make_glyphdata.py`.

For more information, see `absGlyphList/README.md`

_TODO: Figure out whether we can make that reference into a link_

_TODO: Do we need to move the ABS features Google spreadsheet to an .xls or .csv in this repo?_

## bin/

Executable tools in the `/bin` folder include:
- `make_glyphdata.py` - Extract project-specific `glyph_data.csv` from the `absGlyphList.csv`. For more information see `absGlyphList/README.md`
- `makeLamAlefLigs.py` - In a UFO, construct lam-alef ligature glyphs from the component `*.preAlef*` and `*.postLam*` glyphs.
- `absgenclasses.py` - Update some of the glyph classes (defined in the project's `source/classes.xml` file). 
- `absgenftml.py`- Generate ftml tests.

Individual font projects may have `tools/updatescripts.sh` which will copy relevant tools from this folder to the font project's `tools` folder. Tools copied will likely include `absgenclasses.py` and `absgenclasses.py`. These tools use as input:
- One of the UFOs from the font project
- The `glyph_data.csv` from the font project
- Unicode character properties (from UCD).

# Awami Nastaliq

_TODO: We need developer documentation somewhere, not necessarily here. Currently it is in Google Docs._

# Naskh, Kano-style

These two fonts could potentially use the same codebase as each other in the future. However, Alkalami has many swash tailed glyphs that Ruwudu did not need. At this point the two fonts have the same character set.

- `master.feax` - Master source file for OpenType logic. Many/most of the classes have been hand-generated and might benefit from moving to autogenerated classes.

The Alkalami font has a lot of contextual substitutions for all the deep swashes. Ruwudu does not require those.

# Naskh, traditional style

Starting with v4.000, Scheherazade New, Lateef, and Harmattan are being developed and released in parallel. The `gsub.feax` file is identical for all three, and we hope to do additional source code unification in future releases.

_TODO: Create documentation based on Qs that the developer has asked._

- `main.feax` - Master source file for OpenType logic.
  - `gsub.feax` - (Subtitution) lookups
  - `gpos.feax` - Positioning Lookups
    - `customKerning.feax` - This file performs the kerning that is needed for collision avoidance.
    - `customShifting.feax` - This file performs the shifting that is needed for collision avoidance. It must go after mark attachment.
