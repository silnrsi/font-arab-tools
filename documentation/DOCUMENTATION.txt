DOCUMENTATION
font-arab-tools
========================

The documentation for this project is listed in index.html.

There are also PDF versions in the `pdf` folder.

These are produced from markdown sources (in `source`) using pandoc,
weasyprint, and custom python scripts. See the `makedocs` shell script
in the main project folder.

Running makedocs will only work properly if you have the Scheherazade New 
"results" and "web" folders in place. These will need to be copied to font-arab-tools
(but not committed).

There are some infelicities in the pdfs for allah.md and spanning.md. 
These should be handgenerated from the .html files.
