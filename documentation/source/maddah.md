title: Maddah or hamza, etc., relative to vowels

## Introduction

Figuring out the “correct” rendering of sequences of combining marks is one of the challenges of this script. Herein are some references.

### Advice from Unicode list about Maddah

One foray into this question was to ask on the Unicode list how combining _maddah_ interacted with other vowel marks. The resultant thread[[1](#1)] makes it pretty clear that _maddah_ should be rendered above any other vowel marks. 

### Roozbeh Pournader’s proposal — now UTR-53

In Unicode document L2/14-1272[[2](#2)], Roozbeh Pournader proposed to fix the “broken” Arabic combining class values by standardizing on a mark order to be used for rendering. This became UTR-53[[3](#3)] Unicode Arabic Mark Rendering which documents the Arabic Mark Transient Reordering Algorithm (AMTRA).
