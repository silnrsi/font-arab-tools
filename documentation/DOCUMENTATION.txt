DOCUMENTATION
font-arab-tools
========================

The documentation for this project is split into two broad categories:
1. docs that are oriented toward users of Arabic fonts and/or 
    require a working font to render correctly.
2. docs that are oriented toward developers/collaborators.

User-oriented documentation
---------------------------

The user-oriented documentation is provided in two formats: HTML and PDF. 
The PDF documents can be read directly from this repo (whether downloaded or online).
The HTML versions can be opened directly from a downloaded copy of this repo, starting
with `index.html`.

These PDF and HTML files are produced from markdown sources (in `source`) using pandoc,
weasyprint, and custom python scripts. See the `makedocs` shell script
in the main project folder.

To achieve desired rendering in this documentation, Scheherazade, Harmattan, and Lateef 
webfonts are pulled, as needed, from https://fonts.languagetechnology.org/fonts/sil. 
See `assets/css/webfonts.css` for details.

For documents such as `features.md` that turn on language-specific rendering 
for Kyrgyz (ky) and Wolof (wo), weasyprint currently requires 3-letter codes rather than 
the standard 2-letter codes used in html. Therefore, when generating the pdf for 
`features.md` we temporarily replace the lang attributes with values that will 
generate correct rendering (see `makedocs`).


Developer-oriented documentation
--------------------------------

Documentation oriented toward developers and collaborators is all in GitHub-flavored markdown.
It can be viewed directly on GitHub or using a standard markdown previewer with a local 
copy of the repo, starting at `developer\README.md`.
