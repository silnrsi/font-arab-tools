        <h1 class="title">Kasra position relative to shadda</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Note that everything said here about <em>kasra</em> also applies to <em>kasratan</em>.</p>
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The <em>shadda</em> is drawn above the consonant it modifies, and the <em>kasra</em> is normally drawn below the consonant it follows. When both <em>shadda</em> and <em>kasra</em> follow a consonant, there is a difference in traditions about where the <em>kasra</em> is drawn: in some traditions, including Sindhi, the <em>kasra</em> remains below the consonant. In other traditions, including Arabic, the <em>kasra</em> is drawn above the consonant but below the <em>shadda</em>.</p>
    <h3 id="utr53-implications">UTR53 implications</h3>
    <p><a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr53/">Unicode Technical Report #53 (UTR53)</a> does not address the raised <em>kasra</em> convention. As such it doesn’t tell us what to do if there are other “above marks” on the base. But we can make some observations:</p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li><p>With a UTR53 implementation, in the absence of CGJ, the <em>kasra</em> will immediately follow the <em>shadda</em> (since we won’t also have <em>damma</em> or <em>fatha</em>)</p></li>
    <li><p>With CGJ, or in DirectWrite/Uniscribe, the results are unpredictable: the <em>kasra</em> could precede the <em>shadda</em> and there could be multiple marks between the two</p></li>
    <li><p>If there is a <em>kasra</em> out beyond a CGJ, there are several possible interpretations we could make:</p>
    <ol type="a">
    <li><p>The CGJ prevents the raised <em>kasra</em></p></li>
    <li><p>The CGJ prevents the ligation (to allow <em>shadda</em> and <em>kasra</em> to be colored differently) but <em>kasra</em> remains raised (and just under the <em>shadda</em>)</p></li>
    <li><p>The CGJ has no impact (we go ahead and ligate <em>shadda+kasra</em> (or <em>kasra+shadda</em>) (<strong>This is the solution SIL has gone with in their fonts</strong>)</p></li>
    </ol></li>
    <li><p>But an interpretation we cannot make is</p>
    <ol start="4" type="a">
    <li>The <em>kasra</em> should -- because of the inside-out rendering assumed by UTR53 -- somehow be rendered above the <em>shadda</em>. (This cannot be correct since it would then appear to be a <em>fatha</em>)</li>
    </ol></li>
    </ol>
