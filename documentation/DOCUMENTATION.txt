DOCUMENTATION
font-arab-tools
========================

The documentation for this project is listed in index.html.

There are also PDF versions in the `pdf` folder.

Developer notes:

These are produced from markdown sources (in `source`) using pandoc,
weasyprint, and custom python scripts. See the `makedocs` shell script
in the main project folder.

To achieve desired rendering in this documentation, Scheherazade, Harmattan, and Lateef 
webfonts are pulled, as needed, from https://fonts.languagetechnology.org/fonts/sil. 
See assets/css/webfonts.css for details.

For documents such as features.md that turn on language-specific rendering 
for Kyrgyz (ky) and Wolof (wo), weasyprint requires 3-letter codes rather than 
the standard 2-letter codes used in html. Therefore, when generating the pdf for 
features.md we temporarily replace the lang attributes with values that will 
generate correct rendering (see `makedocs`).
